            Hello! My name is Celeste Lewis. I live in Chattanooga, TN and 
            I am 23 years old.  I have two cats named Grumpy and Spaghetti,
            and I live with a dog named Noodle.  I enjoy drawing, video games,
            reading, and hanging out with friends. I am excited about learning programming,
            and still feel like a beginner.  Thank you!
        </p>
